Ai tool set up using openai assistant and connected through the api. 
You need to purchase tokens in order to use, very cheap and get a lot for $5.
Use http-server and node.js to set up. 
I did not list all set up commands but requires the following (use --no-fund):
npm install _: langchain, openai, cors, express, axios(unsure if it was actually needed), dotenv, -g http-server.
For further help/questions, just ask! I am a bit new at github sorry.
Make your own .env file with format: 
// OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>
// OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=<ID>
